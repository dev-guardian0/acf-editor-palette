## Requirements

- [PHP](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/install.php) >= 7.2
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

## Installation

### Bedrock

Install via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require log1x/acf-editor-palette
```

### Manual

Download the release `.zip` and install into `wp-content/plugins`.

## Usage

Pretty straight forward.

- Colors are automatically loaded from the editor palette.
- Return format is keyed the same as when [registered](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/) in the palette.
- Default value can optionally be set using the color's slug.

```php
^ array:3 [â–¼
  "name" => "Green (500)"
  "slug" => "green-500"
  "color" => "#0e9f6e"
]
```

### ACF Composer

If you are on Sage 10 and using my [ACF Composer](https://github.com/log1x/acf-composer) package:

```php
$field
  ->addField('my_color_field', 'editor_palette')
    ->setConfig('default_value' => 'green-500')
    ->setConfig('return_value' => 'slug');
```

## Todo
